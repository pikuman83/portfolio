      In the early days of the pandemic,  
      totally locked down, one day while surfing the web, a word,
      "Android Studio" got my attention. 
      I downloaded it. While playing with the demo app,
      Suddenly, it was lunch time and I DIDN'T want it
      <br>What happened? I didn't know. Still with the app

      now it's dinner time and I'm still not hungry. What's going on here?
      <br>To get the answer, I had to travel 22 years back in time, when while studying Computer Science, 
      together with a friend, we created a <span class="italic">startup to digitalize local companies</span>, which I left when 
      I to moved to Barcelona.
      <br>!! Suddenly I realised, it was the reawakening of <strong class="bold">my old passion!!</strong>

      The start-up, "MB-TECH", is still alive and, back at the beginning of the pandemic, it was in need of innovation.
      So I took up the challenge to <span class="italic">remake</span> one of their VB based major apps (a very complete <span class="bold">ERP</span>) as a <span class="bold">PWA</span>, details of which can be found in the "Projects" tab.
      <br>Although I've been <span class="bold">learning by doing</span>, I've been able to work as a full stack developer at a <span class="italic">decent pace</span> on this project.

      Currently, doing a <span class="italic">"Google Digital Workshop"</span> "Build your web presence" and looking forward to attend courses related 
      to <span class="bold">Arduino & Automation</span> in september. I am also actively trying to step up my knowledge of <span class="italic">state control</span> (Ngrx || Ngxs) 
      and <span class="italic">Unit Testing</span>.
