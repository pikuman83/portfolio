        In the early days of the pandemic, 
        <br>totally locked down, one day while surfing the web, a word,
        <br>"Android Studio" got my attention. 
        <br>I downloaded it. While playing with the demo app

      <p>Suddenly, it was lunch time and I DIDN'T want it
        <br>What happened? I didn't know. 
        <br>Still with the app, now it's dinner time and I'm still not hungry.
        <br>What's going on here?

      <p>To get the answer, I had to travel 22 years back in time, when while studying Computer Science, together with a friend,
        we created a startup to digitalize local companies, which I left when I to moved to Barcelona.
      <br><strong class="interval">!! Suddenly I realised, it was the reawakening of my old passion!!</strong> 
      <br>The start-up, "MB-TECH", is still alive and, back at the beginning of the pandemic, it was in need of innovation.
      So I took up the challenge to migrate one of their major apps, an ERP, to a PWA, details of which can be found in the "Projects" tab.
      <br>Although I've been learning by doing, I've been able to work as a full stack developer at a decent pace on this project. 
      Currently, I am looking for small projects to step up my knowledge on state control (Ngrx || Ngxs) and Unit Testing. 
      <br>I am, also available to work as an intern for a short period. Regarding my professional background, I've been working since 2006 and 
      am currently an employee of "Barcel√≥ Hotels Group", working as a reservation agent.
