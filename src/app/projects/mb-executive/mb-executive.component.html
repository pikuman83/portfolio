            MB-Tech hired me with the goal to develop a new app which could provide <span class="italic"> remote access to the data</span>  
            of one of their major desktop apps. I was trusted with the full responibility of both Front and Backend. Some 
            of the key challanges were reusing the Reports and hosting on their private server.
